Guide to adding new Azure DevOps client to bug count.
=====================================================


1. Create 'shared query'
-------------------------
This will require permission access to create and store shared queries.

Work Item Type = Bug
Created Date >= @Today - 6

Once created get the ID of the query from the Editor page URL
(Client example d2ba358d-8309-46b2-aed9-0c2efb008389)

Then put the ID in the following format URL: 

https://dev.azure.com/CLIENT/PROJECT/
https://CLIENT.visualstudio.com/PROJECT/
_apis/wit/wiql/
ID GOES HERE
?api-version=4.1

Example (https://client.visualstudio.com/WalledGarden/_apis/wit/wiql/d2ea358d-8309-46b2-aed9-0c2efb008389?api-version=4.1)


2. Add client to array
----------------------

Inside Clients.cs add the new client to the list object. in the following format:

new Object[] { "CLIENT", 0, 0, "ADO ACCESS KEY" }       // 11 CLIENT

The access key can be a pre-existing key from a Microsoft account.
OR
An access key with another acount that has access to the releveant project.

Note when running the app, if you get an error at 'JObject jiraResults = JObject.Parse(jiraJson);' This probably means your PAT key is incorrect.


3. Add client to ADO job list
-----------------------------

Inside program.cs add the new client in so that the applicaiton runs a count and includes it.

// CLIENT
VSTS.GetIssues("JOB NUMBER", ARRAY NUMBER, "qa", "QUEERY URL");
